# Car_Insurance_Claim
This experimental work aims to investigate the influence of bias in car insurance claims. The study uses a dataset of car insurance policyholders' information, which includes demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and race, to develop a classification model that predicts the chance of a policyholder filing an insurance claim.
